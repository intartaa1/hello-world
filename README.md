Hello! My name is Antonio Intartaglia and I am a senior here at SUNY New Paltz.
This is my first time taking a class with Professor Plotkin and I am just easing my
way back into HTML and CSS. I am someone who's very honest with the work I put into
school and outside of it. I am also someone who's hardworking and who manages my time
well, meaning that I don't put off assignments or tasks that I'm given. My computer
experience dates back all the way from my senior year of hs when I took courses in
Computer Applications where I gained experience in working with Microsoft Word and Excel.
I took a year off from taking any course related to computers in order to take general
education courses. Some courses I took, through the majority of being online during COVID,
was History of Jazz where I got to learn about musicians who influenced the jazz genre and
the other genres that inspired jazz. I also took History of Film where I got to learn about
the different genres of film and watched films and analyzed the films of popular directors
like Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino. If it wasn't easy to tell already, I am big into history.
A fun class that I got to take for computer science was Software Engineering last semester with
Professor Denizard where I had a semester with a group to create a game. Our game was called "Safari
Snapshot" and it was targeted towards middle schoolers taking biology/Earth science courses.
The objective of the game was to take pictures of animals on an island the main character was 
set on and collect tokens based on animals that had their pictures taken. The player could also take
quizzes to boost their knowledge on specific animals. Overall, it was a great game to make and it
was considered marketing potential.

After gaining a basic grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I see myself using the web developing skills
by creating and maintaining websites for other organizations. Since I am looking to pursue either
computer programming, cyber security or data analytics, if I were to go in the direction of web programming,
working for a web design studio or an advertising firm would be fun. The web development skills that
I acquire towards a software engineering position, or continue to work on "Safari Snapshot" due to some bugs
found in the game.
